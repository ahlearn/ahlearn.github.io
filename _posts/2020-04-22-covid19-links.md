I read many online artices about COVID-19, but only some are good and useful (to me).  I saved most of the links, and share them here:

# Precautions
- What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic -- a professor of pathology <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22470256>
  - precautions
    - NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
    - Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
    - Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door.
      - Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
    - Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
    - Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
    - Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
    - If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!
  - What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
    - Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
      - This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you!
      - BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious.
      - The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.
      - This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
    - Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!).
      - This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific.
      - The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
    - Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family).
      - The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
    - Stock up now with zinc lozenges.
      - These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx.
      - Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY "cold-like" symptoms beginning.
      - It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.

  - 雖然這位南非泳手在2018年底已退役，但現年31歲的他強調自己一直保持健康生活習慣，「我的身體很強壯、肺部很強健，我沒有吸煙，而且也很年輕，是受病毒影響較小的年齡層。」
  - 儘管擁有絕佳身體質素，但雲達貝克直言，新冠肺炎是他患上過「最惡劣的病」
  - 「我已跟病毒搏鬥了14天，儘管最壞的症狀──包括極高燒，已經減緩了，但我的身體仍然非常虛弱乏力，也未能擺脫咳嗽」
  - 更可怕的是，過往能在泳池中馳騁的他，近乎失去了平常的活動能力：「任何活動，例如步行，已能令我疲累幾小時」。

# Misc
- The psychological reasons people are panic hoarding toilet paper amid the coronavirus pandemic <https://www.psypost.org/2020/03/the-psychological-reasons-people-are-panic-hoarding-toilet-paper-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-56114>
  - Stocking up on toilet paper is … a relatively cheap action, and people like to think that they are ‘doing something’ when they feel at risk.
  - This is an example of “zero risk bias,” in which people prefer to try to eliminate one type of possibly superficial risk entirely rather than do something that would reduce their total risk by a greater amount.
  - Hoarding also makes people feel secure. This is especially relevant when the world is faced with a novel disease over which all of us have little or no control. However, we can control things like having enough toilet paper in case we are quarantined.
  - It’s also possible we are biologically programmed to hoard. Birds, squirrels and other animals tend to hoard stuff.

  - 她曾供職的美國Biogen公司將其解僱，指她「在沒有告知公司和無視衛生專家指引的情況下做出了前往中國的個人決定」。Biogen公司聲明稱，黎女士不再是該公司雇員，「她的行為與公司的價值觀念不符。」
  - 黎女士先是被立案偵查，然後又丟了工作，可謂前程盡毀，但無法贏得世人同情，因為今日局面是她一手造成的，因為她的過錯讓無辜的大眾買單，讓同航班的機上人員淪為受害者。
