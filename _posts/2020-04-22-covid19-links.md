I read many online artices about COVID-19, some are good and useful, but some are misleading.  I saved all the links of useful (to me) articles, and share them here:

- Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) | CDC <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html>
- What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic &#x2013; a professor of pathology <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22470256>
  - precautions
    - NO HANDSHAKING! Use a fist bump, slight bow, elbow bump, etc.
    - Use ONLY your knuckle to touch light switches. elevator buttons, etc.. Lift the gasoline dispenser with a paper towel or use a disposable glove.
    - Open doors with your closed fist or hip - do not grasp the handle with your hand, unless there is no other way to open the door.
      - Especially important on bathroom and post office/commercial doors.
    - Use disinfectant wipes at the stores when they are available, including wiping the handle and child seat in grocery carts.
    - Wash your hands with soap for 10-20 seconds and/or use a greater than 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer whenever you return home from ANY activity that involves locations where other people have been.
    - Keep a bottle of sanitizer available at each of your home's entrances. AND in your car for use after getting gas or touching other contaminated objects when you can't immediately wash your hands.
    - If possible, cough or sneeze into a disposable tissue and discard. Use your elbow only if you have to. The clothing on your elbow will contain infectious virus that can be passed on for up to a week or more!
  - What I have stocked in preparation for the pandemic spread to the US:
    - Latex or nitrile latex disposable gloves for use when going shopping, using the gasoline pump, and all other outside activity when you come in contact with contaminated areas.
      - This virus is spread in large droplets by coughing and sneezing. This means that the air will not infect you!
      - BUT all the surfaces where these droplets land are infectious for about a week on average - everything that is associated with infected people will be contaminated and potentially infectious.
      - The virus is on surfaces and you will not be infected unless your unprotected face is directly coughed or sneezed upon.
      - This virus only has cell receptors for lung cells (it only infects your lungs) The only way for the virus to infect you is through your nose or mouth via your hands or an infected cough or sneeze onto or into your nose or mouth.
    - Stock up now with disposable surgical masks and use them to prevent you from touching your nose and/or mouth (We touch our nose/mouth 90X/day without knowing it!).
      - This is the only way this virus can infect you - it is lung-specific.
      - The mask will not prevent the virus in a direct sneeze from getting into your nose or mouth - it is only to keep you from touching your nose or mouth.
    - Stock up now with hand sanitizers and latex/nitrile gloves (get the appropriate sizes for your family).
      - The hand sanitizers must be alcohol-based and greater than 60% alcohol to be effective.
    - Stock up now with zinc lozenges.
      - These lozenges have been proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx.
      - Use as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY "cold-like" symptoms beginning.
      - It is best to lie down and let the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but there are other brands available.

- The psychological reasons people are panic hoarding toilet paper amid the coronavirus pandemic https://www.psypost.org/2020/03/the-psychological-reasons-people-are-panic-hoarding-toilet-paper-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic-56114
  - Stocking up on toilet paper is … a relatively cheap action, and people like to think that they are ‘doing something’ when they feel at risk.
  - This is an example of “zero risk bias,” in which people prefer to try to eliminate one type of possibly superficial risk entirely rather than do something that would reduce their total risk by a greater amount.
  - Hoarding also makes people feel secure. This is especially relevant when the world is faced with a novel disease over which all of us have little or no control. However, we can control things like having enough toilet paper in case we are quarantined.
  - It’s also possible we are biologically programmed to hoard. Birds, squirrels and other animals tend to hoard stuff.
